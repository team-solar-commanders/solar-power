        <img src="../imgs/plates.jpg" class="imgtut">
        <p class="par-tut">
          All nations of the world depend on fossil fuels for their energy needs.
          However the obligation to reduce CO2 and other gaseous emissions in
          order to be in conformity with the Kyoto agreement is the reason behind
          which countries turn to non-polluting renewable energy sources. In this
          paper the pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is initially
          presented followed by a study on the environmental protection offered by
          the two most widely used renewable energy systems, i.e. solar water
          heating and solar space heating. The results presented in this paper
          show that by using solar energy, considerable amounts of greenhouse
          polluting gasses are avoided. For the case of a domestic water heating
          system, the saving, compared to a conventional system, is about 80% with
          electricity or Diesel backup and is about 75% with both electricity and
          Diesel backup. In the case of space heating and hot water system the
          saving is about 40%. It should be noted, however, that in the latter,
          much greater quantities of pollutant gasses are avoided. Additionally,
          all systems investigated give positive and very promising financial
          characteristics. With respect to life cycle assessment of the systems,
          the energy spent for manufacture and installation of the solar systems
          is recouped in about 1.2 years, whereas the payback time with respect to
          emissions produced from the embodied energy required for the manufacture
          and installation of the systems varies from a few months to 9.5 years
          according to the fuel and the particular pollutant considered. Moreover,
          due to the higher solar contribution, solar water heating systems have
          much shorter payback times than solar space heating systems. It can,
          therefore, be concluded that solar energy systems offer significant
          protection to the environment and should be employed whenever possible
          in order to achieve a sustainable future.

      <img class="imgtut" src="../imgs/solarcell.png">
      <p class="par-tut">
        Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays
        and convert them into electricity Description: A solar panel_ is
        actually a collection of solar cells, which can be used to generate
        electricity through photovoltaic_ effect. These cells are arranged in a
        grid-like pattern on the surface of solar panels.

      <p class="par-tut">
        defination of photovoltaic effect The photovoltaic effect is a process
        that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when
        it is exposed to sunlight. It is this effect that makes solar panels
        useful, as it is how the cells within the panel convert sunlight to
        electrical energy. The photovoltaic effect was first discovered in 1839
        by Edmond Becquerel. When doing experiments involving wet cells, he
        noted that the voltage of the cell increased when its silver plates were
        exposed to the sunlight
        Thus, it may also be described as a set of photovoltaic modules, mounted
        on a structure supporting it. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a packaged
        and connected assembly of 6×10 solar cells. When it comes to
        wear-and-tear, these panels are very hardy. Solar panels wear out
        extremely slow. In a year, their effectiveness decreases only about one
        to two per cent (at times, even lesser). Most solar panels are made up
        using crystalline silicon solar cells. Installation of solar panels in
        homes helps in combating the harmful emissions of greenhouse gases and
        thus helps reduce global warming. Solar panels do not lead to any form
        of pollution and are clean. They also decrease our reliance on fossil
        fuels (which are limited) and traditional power sources. These days,
        solar panels are used in wide-ranging electronic equipments like
        calculators, which work as long as sunlight is available. However, the
        only major drawback of solar panels is that they are quite costly. Also,
        solar panels are installed outdoors as they need sunlight to get
        charged.

      <h2 class="header-2">INVERTER</h2>
      <img src="../imgs/inverter.jpg" class="imgtut">
      <p class="par-tut">
        A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct
        current
        (DC)
        output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can
        be fed
        into a
        commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance
        of system
        (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar
        power
        inverters
        have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point
        tracking and
        anti-islanding protection.

    <div class="inner3">
      <h2 class="header-2">AC current</h2>
      <p class="par-tut">
        Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its
        magnitude
        continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction.
        Alternating
        current
        is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of
        electrical
        energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric
        lamps
        into a
        wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and
        DC are
        often
        used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.

    <div class="inner4">
      <h2 class="header-2">DC current</h2>
      <p class="par-tut">
        Direct current (DC) is one-directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime
        example of
        DC
        power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through
        semiconductors,
        insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a
        constant
        direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of
        current was
        galvanic current.

      <p class="par-tut">
        A stand-alone power system (SAPS or SPS), also known as remote area power supply (RAPS), is an
        off-the-grid
        electricity system for locations that are not fitted with an electricity distribution system. Typical
        SAPS
        include
        one or more methods of electricity generation, energy storage, and regulation.
        Storage is typically implemented as a battery bank, but other solutions exist including fuel cells.
        Power
        drawn
        directly from the battery will be direct current extra-low voltage (DC ELV), and this is used
        especially for
        lighting as well as for DC appliances. An inverter is used to generate AC low voltage, which more
        typical
        appliances can be used with.A typical stand-alone solar PV system at a sewage treatment plant in
        Santuari de
        Lluc,

        panels only

        may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator, a wind turbine or batteries.

        A grid-connected photovoltaic system, or grid-connected PV system is an electricity generating solar
        PV power
        system that is connected to the utility grid. A grid-connected PV system consists of solar panels, one

        several
        inverters, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment. They range from small residential
        and
        commercial rooftop systems to large utility-scale solar power stations. Unlike stand-alone power
        systems, a
        grid-connected system rarely includes an integrated battery solution, as they are still very
        expensive. When
        conditions are right, the grid-connected PV system supplies the excess power, beyond consumption by
        the
        connected
        load, to the utility grid.
